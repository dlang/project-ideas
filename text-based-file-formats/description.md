## Description

Dlang standard library phobos is missing some facilities to handle text based file formats, like XML or yaml.
Many of those based file formats processing libraries exist in Dlang's package registry code.dlang.org (think npmjs.com).

This project goal is review the existing libraries on code.dlang.org, pick the best ones, gives them a good polish,
extent them where necessary, and integrate them into phobos.

## What are rough milestones of this project?

- do a review of the existing libraries for text based file formats
- select the features that shall be included in the new package
- polish and prepare for standard library inclusion
- add new, unimplemented features

## How does this project help the D community?

XMLs and yamls are everywhere.
Putting the user to jump through some hoops to get the code to use them is an obstacle to adoption.
Having such a module integrated in the D standard library will increase the attractivity of D as a language.

## Recommended skills

- Experience with C++ templates
- Experience with text based file formats
- Experience with code build automation tools

## What can students expect to get out of doing this project?

Students will be exposed with the process of creating a library module from scratch.
Also, students will be encouraged and helped to do a survey of existing solutions that
will help them doing comparative analysis.
