# Simplify the release process

**Mentor:** [Dennis Korpel](dkorpel@gmail.com)

## Description

The release process is currently a semi-automated process where a script is being run but at some
times it requires user intervention. The script is currently doing a lot of things such as: updating
tags, posting a forum message, master-stable merge etc. The purpose of this project is to automate
the process so that no user intervention is required. This means that some parts of the scripts
might be dropped, whereas other components might need to be added. The end result should be a
simple script that is easier to understand, reproducible and fully automated.

## Project milestones:

1. Analyze the existing script and identify parts that should be dropped, improved or kept as is.
1. Implement the necessary parts.
1. Test the script.
1. Document all the parts.
1. Replace existing scripts with the new one.
