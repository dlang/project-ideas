# Symmetry Autumn of Code Project Ideas

The links below lead to descriptions of potential SAOC project ideas that have been endorsed by the D Language Foundation. Applicants are not limited to the ideas in this list&mdash;any project that would be beneficial to the D community is a good candidate for an application. Applicants are encouraged to submit project proposals they find interesting and potentially challenging.

Anyone who submits a proposal for a project that is no longer relevant, e.g., the problem it is intended to solve has already been solved, will be asked to resubmit. The ideas in this list are some that the DLF has determined are relevant to our current goals, so any applicant who choses one can be confident that the idea is not out of date. However, the composition of this list may change up to a month before the application deadline.

Note that an uncurated list of project ideas can be found in [the issue tracker in this repository](https://github.com/dlang/project-ideas/issues).

The projects below are listed in no particular order. Click each link for a detailed description.

* [Separate semantic routines from AST nodes](./separate-semantic-routines-from-ast-nodes/description.md) - a great introductory project for someone with little or no experience with compilers
* [Improve D Error Messages](./improve-d-error-messages/description.md) - another great introductory project for someone with little or no experience with compilers
* [Improve ImportC](./improve-importc/description.md) - involves resolving a number of specific issues with the compiler's ImportC implementation and additional issues if time allows
* [Text-Based File Formats](./text-based-file-formats/description.md) - learn the new Phobos v3 range interface and implement a text-based file reading and writing package from scratch
